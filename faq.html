<!-- SECTION: PARTICIPATION -->
<section class="section card">
  <h2>Who can participate?</h2>
  <p class="muted">
    Participation is open to adults (18+) worldwide. This referendum is a
    <strong>voluntary civic pilot</strong>, not a statutory government election.
  </p>
  <ul class="muted">

    <li>You may participate from any country or region.</li>
    <li>Participation is entirely voluntary and consent-based.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<!-- SECTION: HOW TO VOTE -->
<section class="section card">
  <h2>How do I vote or nominate?</h2>
  <p class="muted">
    Go to the <a href="vote.html"><u>Vote & Nominate</u></a> page and complete the official ballot.
    Once finished, click <strong>Submit Vote Securely</strong>.
  </p>
  <div class="callout">
    <strong>No emails. No file uploads. No intermediaries.</strong><br/>
    Submissions are transmitted automatically to the counting service.
  </div>
</section>

<!-- SECTION: SUBMISSION -->
<section class="section card">
  <h2>What happens when I submit?</h2>
  <ol class="muted">
    <li>Your submission is validated for required fields.</li>
    <li>A pseudonymous deduplication key prevents duplicate counting.</li>
    <li>Your vote is recorded and included in live aggregates.</li>
    <li>You receive a <strong>Receipt ID</strong>.</li>
    <li>A small receipt JSON file downloads automatically for your records.</li>
  </ol>
</section>

<!-- SECTION: RECEIPTS -->
<section class="section card">
  <h2>What is the receipt JSON file?</h2>
  <p class="muted">
    The receipt JSON file is <strong>your proof of submission</strong>. It contains:
  </p>
  <ul class="muted">
    <li>Your Receipt ID</li>
    <li>The time your submission was received</li>
    <li>A cryptographic hash of your submission</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">
    It does <strong>not</strong> contain your full ballot answers or personal information.
    Keep it until results are finalised.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- SECTION: PRIVACY -->
<section class="section card">
  <h2>Is my vote anonymous?</h2>
  <p class="muted">
    The system is designed to minimise personal data.
  </p>
  <ul class="muted">
    <li>No legal names are required.</li>
    <li>No IP addresses are published.</li>
    <li>Only anonymised aggregates are displayed publicly.</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="callout">

  </div>
</section>

<!-- SECTION: DEDUPLICATION -->
<section class="section card">
  <h2>How are duplicate votes prevented?</h2>
  <p class="muted">
    Each submission is associated with a pseudonymous identifier stored locally in your browser.
    The counting service uses a cryptographic deduplication key to ensure:
  </p>
  <ul class="muted">
    <li>Each participant is counted once per voting window.</li>
    <li>Accidental re-submissions are not double-counted.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">
    If you intentionally regenerate your identifier, your submission may be treated as new.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- SECTION: AI -->
<section class="section card">
  <h2>Is AI deciding the results?</h2>
  <p class="muted">
    <strong>No.</strong> Vote totals are counted deterministically by the counting service.
  </p>
  <p class="muted">
    AI systems (including Malcolm AI) may be used to:
  </p>
  <ul class="muted">
    <li>Assist with anomaly detection (e.g. spam patterns)</li>
    <li>Generate high-level narrative summaries</li>
    <li>Support transparency and reporting</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="callout">
    AI does not override votes, invent results, or determine outcomes.
  </div>
</section>

<!-- SECTION: RESULTS -->
<section class="section card">
  <h2>Where can I see the results?</h2>
  <p class="muted">
    Live anonymised totals are published on the
    <a href="transparency.html"><u>Results & Transparency</u></a> page.
  </p>
  <p class="muted">
    This page refreshes automatically and shows:
  </p>
  <ul class="muted">
    <li>Total submissions counted</li>
    <li>Approval and preference rates</li>
    <li>Regional balance indicators</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<!-- SECTION: LEGITIMACY -->
<section class="section card">
  <h2>Is this an official government election?</h2>
  <p class="muted">
    No. This referendum is a <strong>voluntary, exploratory civic initiative</strong>.
    It does not replace or override any statutory electoral process.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- SECTION: ERRORS -->
<section class="section card">
  <h2>What if submission fails?</h2>
  <p class="muted">
    If the live submission service is unavailable, the system will automatically offer
    a manual download of your submission file so you are never blocked from participating.
